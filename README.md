These scripts are created to work best in the A Cloud Guru Azure playground environments.

Azure playgrounds on ACG provide a pre-created resource group and location. Many of the scripts will grab the resource group and its location and assign it to a variable.

If you are using your own Azure tenant with multiple resource groups, you will need to modify the scripts to use your own resource group/location before running the script.
