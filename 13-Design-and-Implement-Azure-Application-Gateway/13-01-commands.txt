To follow along in the Azure Sandbox:
--------
Open the Azure Cloud Shell (PowerShell)
Use the sandbox provided resource group.
Use the same location as your Azure Sandbox resource group.
You can use any unique name for the storage account and any valid name for the file share.

Run:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-az700-Microsoft-Azure-Network-Engineer-Associate/main/13-Design-and-Implement-Azure-Application-Gateway/13-01-app-gw-demo-buildout.json -o setup.json

Edit the setup.json file by opening up the Cloud Shell editor {}
Select setup.json.

In the setup.json file, change:

"appServicePlanName": "cake-hub-web-app-plan",
"webAppPortalName": "cake-hub-web-app",

To be:

"appServicePlanName": "cake-hub-web-app-plan-[some unique characters]",
"webAppPortalName": "cake-hub-web-app-[some unique characters]",

Save the file by clicking in the space below the Cloud Shell editor's X icon on the right and choose `Save`.  You can then click in the space below the Cloud Shell editor's X icon on the right and choose `Close editor`.

You can then run:
$rg = az group list --query '[].name' -o tsv

After that, run:
az deployment group create --resource-group $rg --template-file ./setup.json

You will be prompted for any username and password.
Click enter when asked about the '_artifactsLocationSasToken'.

Your deployment should begin (It will take about 15-20 minutes).
